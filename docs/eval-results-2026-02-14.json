For a full list and any exceptions, see the RTS “What We Take” page.\n- What not to recycle: the items listed above. If in doubt, check the full rules on the RTS page.\n- Trash disposal basics: non-recyclables go into yellow bags; bulky items and clean-outs have separate disposal rules and may involve fees or weigh-in.\n- Special items: mattresses are accepted for recycling at the RTS; clothing/textiles should be donated or recycled separately.\n\nIf you tell me what you’re disposing of, I can point you to the specific items on the RTS list.

      "response": "Property taxes in Needham are set with a split tax rate (commercial/industrial taxed at a higher rate than residential), so the exact amount varies by your property's assessed value and the current rate. On average, residential property owners see about a $1,962 tax savings from the split rate, but your own bill will depend on your assessment and any exemptions.\n\nHow the bills work and how to estimate your own amount:\n- First and second quarter bills: estimated, based on one-fourth of the prior year’s tax plus the 2.5% allowed increase and any overrides.\n- Third and fourth quarter bills: actual tax bills reflecting changes in valuation and the current tax rate; there is also a 2.0% Community Preservation Act surcharge.\n- To determine your exact amount, you’ll need your current assessed value and the town’s current rate.\n\nWho to call for specifics (lead with the number):\n- Assessor's Office: 781-455-7500 — handles your assessment, exemptions, and updates to ownership or billing address.\n- Collector / Treasurer's Office: 781-455-7500 — handles real estate and personal property tax bills and payments (and other town receivables).\n\nGive the Assessor’s or Collector’s Office a call at 781-455-7500 to confirm the details for your specific situation.

Note: you do not have to allow interior entry for a cyclical inspection, but if you file for an abatement and then refuse entry, any formal appeal could be denied.  \n4) If you believe the tax bill itself is incorrect, you can also file a dispute with the DPW within 30 days of the billing date (and you can apply for the abatement through the Assessor’s Office).

The town’s Food Code Enforcement Policy (part of the Food Safety Excellence Program) outlines how food businesses are expected to operate, and it’s the key starting point.\n\nSteps to start a food truck or catering business:\n1) Review the Food Code Enforcement Policy (PDF) and related materials on the Public Health pages.\n2) Look at the Food Safety Excellence Program information to understand best practices and expectations for mobile units.\n3) Check the Public Health Inspection Reports for any relevant guidance or recent findings that could affect your operation.\n4) Contact the Needham Public Health Office to discuss permits, inspections, and any specific requirements for a mobile food operation, then schedule any required inspections and maintain ongoing compliance.\n\nI’m not sure about that one.

The permit review will use your plot plan to verify setbacks.\n- Permit requirement: A building permit is required for construction of a deck (and for any change of use or structural work).\n- Deck plan requirements: Your deck plans must include the details outlined in the Information for Deck Plans.\n- How to apply:\n  1) Confirm permit needs with the Conservation Department during business hours at 781-455-7550, ext. 248.\n  2) Prepare your deck plans with the required information.\n  3) Submit the Building Permit application online via Open/Gov.\n  4) Attach a plot plan and any other required documents; you can look up related forms on the Building page.\n  5) Pay the permit fees online or by other accepted methods.\n- Getting exact setback info for your property: Give the Building Department a call to confirm the exact setback for your address and any site-specific requirements.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me your street address and I’ll help you identify the likely zoning district and next steps.

      "question": "What if I already built my deck without a permit? What happens now?",
      "response": "You’ll likely need to talk with the Building Department to sort out what to do next for a deck built without a permit. Unpermitted work can create issues, especially if you try to sell the property, and the department has ways to get things resolved.\n\nHere’s how to move forward:\n- 1) Check if there is an open permit tied to the deck by contacting the Building Department or using the town’s permit portal.\n- 2) If an open permit exists, work with them to close it out—this usually involves inspections and providing any required documentation.\n- 3) If there isn’t an open permit, ask about retroactive permitting and what inspections would be needed to bring the deck into compliance.\n- 4) Schedule any necessary inspections and obtain the final certificate of completion if applicable.\n- 5) Remember that open permits or code violations can affect future permits and can complicate property transactions.\n\nGive the Building Department a call to confirm the details for your specific situation. Would you like me to help locate the Building Department contact information on the town website?",

      "response": "Short answer: It depends on the property's zoning and any overlays; some parcels can support commercial uses, others are residential or have restrictions.\n\nHow to check:\n- Identify the zoning district for the property (Needham’s zoning designations determine what uses are allowed).\n- Review the zoning bylaw for what uses are allowed in that district and whether a Special Permit or Site Plan Review is required.\n- Check for overlays or district-specific rules that might affect use.\n- Contact the Planning Department to get a formal determination for that specific property.\n\nIf you want, share the property address and I’ll help you interpret the likely district and the next steps.
